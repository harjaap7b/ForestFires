# Forest Fires ML
## Finding the Optimum Machine Learning Model for Predicting Forest Fires

In this project I will be looking at the dataset from the UCI machine learning repository on forest fires. I will be looking at various machine learning models and see which one ideally predicts the extent of fire damage in forests accuractly. I will be starting off with a basic linear regression model and work my way to the most ideal model. This will help us predict how these features might predict future forest fires.
